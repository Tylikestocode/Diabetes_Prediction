# Diabetes Classification
## Overview
In this Notebook I attempt to classify instances on whether they have diabetes or not. I explore the data, checking their distributions and relationships between the target variables. I then decide which machine learning algorithm to implement. After I create the algorithm I evaluate it and come to a conclusion on whether the model is satisfactory or not and what future actions I can take to improve performance.
